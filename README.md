# SAIL-Living-Project by [Israel Adedamola](https://kamii.hashnode.dev/)

### This repo is to record my progress as I embark on a 6-month full-stack developer program with SAIL. I would record my progress from my first hello world in most of the programming languages [HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js] being taught to the significant progress I would have made.

### At the end of the 6-month period, I hope to have two live projects that will have a huge impact on the tech society.
